# wiki-twitter-bot

A fun bot I made that tweets the summary of a random Wikipedia article every hour (or day). 

I built the API wrapper used in this project [here](https://github.com/ayush-shrivastava003/py-twitter-api). It's a little scuffed but it was fun getting it to work (except OAuth1 ðŸ˜¬).
The code on the repo might not be updated yet, and that's because I'm trying to prettify it a bit before pushing the changes.
